# houdini-wrangler
A place to store this growing list of scripts within houdini; typically for wrangle nodes

I am not 100% certain how to encode vex scripts outside of houdini, but my understanding is that they are essentially `c` scripts. So that is the file extension that will be used for vex.

## How to use
Create an attribute wrangle node, and copy the respective file contents into the node's text field.
Note: That each script will have its own input expectations. 
Remember Houdini isn't magic, it's input/output.
